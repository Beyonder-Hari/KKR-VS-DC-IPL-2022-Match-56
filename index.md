 <h2> Match Result </h2>
 <p> Once Again, Predictor <strong>Shri Hari</strong> Predicts The Result after One Year. But Ohhhh Boy! What a match It was for the bowlers. Wicket after wicket after Wicket. And Kudos to Venkatesh Iyer for scoring 43 Runs, Nitish Rana for scoring 43 Runs and Ishan Kishan with a Monstrous 51 Runs. KKR Had Found the Perfect Openers - Ajinkya Rahane and Venkatesh Iyer (Jinks and Venky), Bumrah Back to form - 5 Wickets and a Near Hatrick and Cummins with 3 Wickets. All of these happened in one match. But now we get to the sad/happy part. Ishan Kishan's 51 and Bumrah's 5 Wicket Haul went in Vain as KKR won the match by 52 Runs. MI won the Toss and Decided to Field first. KKR had a good start With Venky,Jinks and Rana but after that Trio Fell The Whole Team Collapsed and set a Decent Total of 165 and Losing 9 Wickets. Mumbai Though, KKR Buried Them. Rohit's Bad Luck streak continued as he only scored 2 Runs, Tilak fell at the Hands of Russel scoring 6 Runs. But when No one excpected, Ishan Kishan, The man that was bought for 15.25 <strong> CRORES!</strong> Scored 51 Runs which helped MI but as soon as he got out, The Match was Over for MI. Pollard and Bumrah got run out, David, Sams, Karthikeya and Ashwin all got Caught and MI Scored 113-All Out.
